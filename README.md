# Phone-Setup
This is a list of apps I use on Android. This list and configuration is for the app obtainium along with configuration settings for some apps.

You can use either the [URL Configuration](https://github.com/AlsoAHuman/Phone-Setup/blob/main/AppListHTML.txt) or the [JSON File](https://github.com/AlsoAHuman/Phone-Setup/blob/main/Obtainium-Export.json) to import the apps into Obtainium
